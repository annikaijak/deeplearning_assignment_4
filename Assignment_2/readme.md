# Deep Learning Assignment 2: Bible Verse Search Engine, Gradient Descent Exercise and Attention Mechanism Exercise

Annika and Mikkels submission for assignment 2 in Deep Learning

## Part one:

For part 1 we're going to create a Bible Verse Semantic Search Engine, where you can use your favorite inspirational quotes to find the best suiting bible verse! The dataset can be found on Kaggle via this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oswinrh/bible?select=t_bbe.csv. We chose to use the dataset containing the Bible in basic english called "t_bbe.csv".

You can test the Bible Verse Search Engine in this link:

## Part two: 

For the Gradient Descent Exercise in Part 2, we're going to use a salary dataset also found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression?select=Salary_dataset.csv. Lastly, we're going to use the sentences "He swung the bat, aiming for a homerun" and "A bat flew quietly in the moonlit night" for the Attention Mechanism Exercise.
