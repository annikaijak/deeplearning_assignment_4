In this assignment, we've made a chatbot for International Cand. Merc. Masters at AAU Business School:
*  Business Data Science
*  Finance
*  Innovation Management
*  International Business
*  Marketing and Sales

The chatbot is built using RAG, Mistral 7B and ChromDB as vector database. The assign also includes three different prompting methods. 

The data has been gathered manually from the information page for each of the five masters. In addition, we have downloaded the curriculum for each of the masters in PDF format.

In the notebook, you can find a Gradio Chatbot, where you can test the RAG system.
