# Deep Learning Assignment 3: Scientific Article QA System
Annika and Mikkels submission for assingment 3 in deep learning

This notebook is a QA system based on the scientific paper "Using sequences of life-events to predict
human lives" by Savcisens et al. The system uses the document to answer complex questions about the paper using the "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1" model. 

We've used the paper to make a Q&A system using RAG that retrieves information from the paper and answers any questions, you may have.

The research paper can be found at: https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-023-00573-5
